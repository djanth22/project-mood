## Project Mood is a little idea to help show moods and journal feelings and thoughts. The project started as a way to help express the way I feel and vent excess frustrations, thoughts, hopes, anxieties etc. To better help in my own journey through struggles with mental health.

# The goals/aims/features of Project mood

- being able to choose a mood that reflects current feelings and have that update instantly on the web app

- a journal section to jot down thoughts or feelings more directly and with as much or little detail as one would like to

- the ability to connect with friends and loved ones as a way for better communications of how you feel when struggling to talk or express such things directly, through a feed that someone you are connected with can see and interact with

- the ability to hide or privatise posts/entries so that these are only visible to you and no one else, should you have connections that you may not want to see certain things in the jounal entries without limits.

- possibility of commenting, reacting, or engaging with entries in a connections feed for support or help

- the ability to delete a journal entry or simply make adjustments if needed

- possibly more TBD

# Things to keep in mind

- these entries are not to be permanent only as long as they are needed - a feature may be needed for either reviewing entries done by the poster to decide which to keep and which to delete - a simple prompt of sorts or perhaps a timer that automatically deletes entries after a certain period of time has elapsed. Should the latter be the case, there would likely need to also be a system in place for 'saving' these entries in a favourites style panel/page for the sake of making sure only the entries that are not 'starred' are deleted after the elapsed time - the exact time of which is still to be decided

- This is NOT a social media site/app, as such there is no need for upvotes, dislikes or necessarily comment type interactions seen on many platforms. There should be some level of interaction from connections should a person be wanting to reach out for help but this is not a place for bullying or added trauma of any kind. with this in mind - a profanity filter type mechanism should be in place to prevent the posting of comments that encourage any harm or negativity. This will require some research in to how something like this can be implemented

- While the different aspects of the app at this stage are to be designed around using different pages and a navigation based system, the app needs to be quite simple and intuitive - also preference based customisations should be considered later once everything is more or less functional

- more TBD

## progress log

This log will follow a simple format and is to supplement the github commit log and add a bit more insight into any changes that may not be evident between each commit and will be as follows

# date day/month/year

# progress - what has been done

# 05/05/2025

- first log entry, exciting stuff. Set up for the app using Next.js and refamiliarising myself with previous projects to plan out this project and how I would like it to function.
- so far so good, but I do not expect too much progress done today in terms of functionality, but I am hoping that some of what I need comes back to me through reviewing older projects so that I can at least begin to put everything together. I am expecting plenty of bugs
